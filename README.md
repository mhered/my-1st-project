# my-1st-project

Final project for the Building AI course. Also my first time using AI, python, GitHub and Raspberry Pi. What could go wrong? 

## Summary

The goal of this project is to build a desktop-sized automatic sorter for small objects (e.g. Lego parts, marbles or smarties) based on artificial vision. 

## Background

The project is a simple pilot to demonstrate the different building blocks needed for AI-based industrial applications:
* programming
* mechatronics 
* training an AI model

## How is it used?

The idea is building a desktop-sized sorter, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, to keep at home or at the office.

![A first sketch of the concept](https://github.com/mhered/my-1st-project/blob/mhered-patch-1/first-draft.jpg)



Here there will be code snippets:
```
def main():
   # here there will be some sample code
   
   while True:
      pass

main()
```

## Data sources, Equipment and AI methods

I plan to collect the data needed to train the model using the actual setup.

| Element   | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Computer     | Raspberry Pi 4       |
| Camera   |   Pi Camera V2      |
| ...      | ...       |

## Challenges

This is _not_ a professional project or a professionally developed tutorial for beginners. This is an honest to God first try so it i doubful whether it should be taken as an example. That said, if you find anything here useful I am happy to share, just be warned!

## What next?

This is a basic demonstrator with a very limited scope, and the main purpose is to gain experience on the different fields and technologies involved. 

Ultimately the goal will be to later expand the scope to deal with more complex real industrial applications such as detection of defects for quality control, FOD detection in aircraft or garbage sorting for recycling.
