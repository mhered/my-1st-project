# my-1st-project

My first AI project in python. Also, final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The goal of this project is to build a desktop-sized automatic sorter for small objects (e.g. lego parts, marbles or smarties) based on artificial vision. 

## Background

The project is a simple pilot to demonstrate the different building blocks needed for AI-based industrial applications:
* mechatronics 
* programming
* training an AI model

## How is it used?

The idea is building a desktop-sized working sorter, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, to keep either at home or at the office.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

Here will be code snippets:
```
def main():
   # here will be some sample code
   
   while True:
      pass

main()
```

## Data sources and AI methods

I plan to collect the data myself using a Picamera

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

This is a basic demonstrator with a very limited scope, and the main purpose is to gain experience on the above fields. 

Ultimately the goal will be to later expand the scope to deal with real industrial applications such as detection of defects for quality control, FOD detection in aircraft or garbage sorting for recycling.
